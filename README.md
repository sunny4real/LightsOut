# LightsOut
Lights Out is a puzzle game consisting of an n x n grid of lights. 
At the beginning of the game, some of the lights are switched on. 
When a light is pressed, this light and the four adjacent lights are toggled, i.e., they are switched on if they were off, 
and switched off otherwise. The purpose of the game is to switch all the lights off.

The game starts with some lights turned on, and the user keeps playing till he either gives up or turns off all the lights.
